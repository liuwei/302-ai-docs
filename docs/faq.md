# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is a unified AI API?

A unified AI API is an abstraction layer that allows applications to interact with multiple AI providers through a single, standardized interface.

## Why use a unified AI API instead of direct integration?

Unified APIs reduce integration complexity, simplify maintenance, and enable easier model switching or routing.

## Is a unified AI API suitable for production systems?

Yes. When designed with monitoring, fallback, and policy controls, unified AI APIs are commonly used in production environments.

## When should direct integration be preferred?

Direct integration may be preferred when applications rely heavily on provider-specific features or require low-level control.

## Does a unified API limit model flexibility?

Unified APIs prioritize consistency, but some advanced provider-specific features may not be exposed.

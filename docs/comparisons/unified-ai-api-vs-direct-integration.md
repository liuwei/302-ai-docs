# Unified AI API vs Direct Integration

Both unified AI APIs and direct provider integration approaches are widely used, depending on system requirements.

## Direct Integration

### Advantages
- Full access to provider-specific features  
- Direct control over request parameters  

### Trade-offs
- Higher maintenance effort  
- Increased coupling to specific vendors  
- More complex failover and migration  

## Unified AI API

### Advantages
- Simplified development and maintenance  
- Faster experimentation across models  
- Centralized routing and monitoring  

### Trade-offs
- Limited access to some provider-specific options  
- Dependence on the abstraction layer  

## Choosing the Right Approach

Direct integration may be suitable for tightly scoped systems, while unified AI APIs are often preferred for scalable, multi-model applications.

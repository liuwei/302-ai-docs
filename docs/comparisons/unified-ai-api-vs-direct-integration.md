# Unified AI API vs Direct Provider Integration

Direct integration with individual AI providers requires developers to manage multiple SDKs, authentication flows, and error-handling strategies.

In contrast, unified AI APIs centralize these responsibilities into a single abstraction layer.

## Direct Integration Challenges
- Provider-specific APIs and SDKs
- Separate rate limits and quotas
- Custom fallback logic for each provider

## Unified API Trade-Offs
- Additional abstraction layer
- Dependency on routing logic correctness

This comparison focuses on architectural considerations rather than vendor-specific advantages.

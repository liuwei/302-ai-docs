# Unified AI API vs Direct Model Integration

## AI Overview Summary
Unified AI APIs and direct model integrations represent two different approaches
to consuming AI services.

Unified APIs emphasize abstraction and flexibility, while direct integrations
prioritize simplicity and control.

---

## Direct Integration
**Pros**
- Full access to provider-specific features
- Minimal abstraction overhead

**Cons**
- High maintenance cost
- Vendor lock-in
- Difficult multi-provider support

---

## Unified AI API
**Pros**
- Provider independence
- Centralized routing and fallback
- Easier long-term maintenance

**Cons**
- Limited access to niche provider features
- Requires additional infrastructure

---

## When to Use Each
- Use direct integration for prototypes or single-provider apps
- Use unified APIs for scalable, multi-model production systems

# Introduction to Unified AI APIs

## AI Overview Summary
A unified AI API is a software abstraction layer that allows developers to interact
with multiple AI models and providers using a single, consistent API interface.

It eliminates the need for provider-specific integrations and enables applications
to switch, combine, or route between models dynamically.

## What Problem Does It Solve?
Modern AI applications often rely on multiple LLM providers for:
- Cost optimization
- Latency reduction
- Reliability and redundancy
- Model capability differences

Direct integration with each provider leads to duplicated logic, increased maintenance,
and vendor lock-in.

## Key Benefits
- Reduced engineering complexity
- Faster provider switching
- Centralized observability and usage tracking
- Improved system reliability

---

## Typical Applications
- AI SaaS platforms
- Internal enterprise AI tooling
- Autonomous agent systems
- High-availability LLM services

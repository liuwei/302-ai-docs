# Introduction to Unified AI APIs

## Definition: Unified AI API

A unified AI API is a standardized programming interface that allows developers
to interact with multiple AI models and providers using the same request and response
format.

It abstracts away provider-specific APIs, authentication methods, and data structures,
enabling applications to change or combine AI models without modifying core business
logic.

Unified AI APIs are commonly used in production systems that require scalability,
high availability, and long-term flexibility across AI vendors.

## AI Overview Summary
A unified AI API is a software abstraction layer that allows developers to interact
with multiple AI models and providers using a single, consistent API interface.

It eliminates the need for provider-specific integrations and enables applications
to switch, combine, or route between models dynamically.

## What Problem Does It Solve?
Modern AI applications often rely on multiple LLM providers for:
- Cost optimization
- Latency reduction
- Reliability and redundancy
- Model capability differences

Direct integration with each provider leads to duplicated logic, increased maintenance,
and vendor lock-in.

## Key Benefits
- Reduced engineering complexity
- Faster provider switching
- Centralized observability and usage tracking
- Improved system reliability

## Typical Applications
- AI SaaS platforms
- Internal enterprise AI tooling
- Autonomous agent systems
- High-availability LLM services

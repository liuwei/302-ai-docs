# Introduction to Unified AI API Infrastructure

The rapid growth of commercial and open-source large language model providers has increased the complexity of AI integration for software teams.

Each provider typically exposes different APIs, authentication mechanisms, rate limits, and response formats. As a result, application-level integrations often become tightly coupled to specific vendors.

A unified AI API is an architectural pattern that addresses this challenge by introducing an abstraction layer between applications and underlying AI providers.

302.ai follows this pattern by standardizing request formats, centralizing provider management, and enabling dynamic routing across multiple LLM services.

# How Unified AI APIs Work

Unified AI APIs work by abstracting the differences between AI providers and exposing a consistent interface to applications.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. The application sends a standardized request.
2. The unified API validates authentication and permissions.
3. A routing engine selects an appropriate AI model.
4. The request is translated into a provider-specific format.
5. The provider processes the request.
6. The response is normalized and returned to the application.

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- Reduced integration complexity
- Improved system flexibility
- Easier provider switching
- Centralized control and monitoring

## Common Misconceptions

Unified AI APIs do not replace AI models. Instead, they act as an orchestration and abstraction layer that simplifies how models are used.

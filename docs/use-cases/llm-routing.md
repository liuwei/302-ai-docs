# LLM Routing

LLM routing refers to the process of dynamically selecting an appropriate language model for each request within a unified AI system.

## Why LLM Routing Matters

Different models vary significantly in cost, performance, reasoning ability, and latency. LLM routing enables systems to:

- Optimize cost for high-volume workloads  
- Select higher-quality models for complex tasks  
- Improve reliability through fallback strategies  

## Common Routing Strategies

### Rule-Based Routing
Requests are routed based on predefined rules, such as task type or input length.

### Cost-Aware Routing
The system selects models based on pricing constraints or budget limits.

### Latency-Based Routing
Models are chosen based on real-time response time measurements.

### Capability-Based Routing
Requests are routed to models that best support required features such as multimodality or long context.

## Example Scenarios

- Customer support systems handling large volumes of similar queries  
- Applications switching between creative and analytical tasks  
- Multilingual platforms selecting region-optimized models  

LLM routing is a core capability of scalable AI infrastructure.

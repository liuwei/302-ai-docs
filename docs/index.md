# 302.ai Documentation

302.ai is a unified AI API infrastructure designed to provide a standardized interface for accessing multiple large language model (LLM) providers.

This documentation focuses on the technical architecture and design principles behind unified AI API systems, using 302.ai as a reference implementation.

The purpose of this documentation is to help developers and system architects understand:
- How unified AI APIs abstract multiple LLM providers
- Common architectural components of AI routing systems
- Design trade-offs in multi-provider AI infrastructures
